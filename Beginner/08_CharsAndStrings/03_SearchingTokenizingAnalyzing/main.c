 *  - Tokenizing a string: a token is a sequence of characters within a string
 *      that is bounded by a delimiter (space, comma, period, etc.);
 *      TIP: breaking a sentence into words is called tokenizing.
 *  - Analyzing strings: is lower, is upper, is digit, etc.
 *
 *  TIP: To better manage these functions we have to know about Pointers
